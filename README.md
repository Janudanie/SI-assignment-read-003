## The assigment

In year 2000, the software engineer and researcher Roy Fielding (https://roy.gbiv.com/) published his PhD thesis (https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm), entitled Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, in which he introduced and defined the concept behind the now so popular

abbreviation REST.



Read the document and find out the answers of the following questions:

1. What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?

2. Why is the dissertation considered so important for the software-architectural

world?

3. Which is the most valuable outcome you personally get from it?

4. How could you implement it in your own practice as a software developer?



Submit the answers in Peergrade and read the answers of at least three of your colleagues,

to validate your and their vision.



This task is individual and brings you five credits.

### Answers
#### What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?
```
What exactly is REST?
REST is short for Representational state transfer.
It is a way to transfer data between systems in an easy way.
Primarily using JSON or XML style documents.

How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?
REST is a architectural style that can be used in a network-based software architectures.
So it fits perfectly, could have used another architectural style if he had wanted,
just think this is the one that holds the uses.
```

#### Why is the dissertation considered so important for the software-architectural world?
```
I have no idea, most of what there is written is something we already know or have heard.
I think over time the things written have rippled out, and you learn it also from others sources.
```



#### Which is the most valuable outcome you personally get from it?
```
I learn best from doing and seeing examples, i dont think i am getting alot of value out of just reading it.
I would more have to read sections of it, and have a virtuel lab to do some experiments in.
```




#### How could you implement it in your own practice as a software developer?
```
I would proberbly if a had an assignment that conserned a section of the thesis again, and see if it would help me.
I would also be very skeptic about it, the informatation in the thesis is 20 years old,
some of it might really be a good way of doing it anymore.
